Welcome to Policy Manager GE
============================

Introduction
============

The Policy Manager GE provides the basic management of cloud resources based on rules, as well as management 
of the corresponding resources within the FIWARE Cloud Instance like actions based on physical monitoring or 
infrastructure, security monitoring of resources and services or whatever that could be defined by facts, 
actions and rules. Policy Manager is a easy rule engine designed to be used in the OpenStack ecosystem and of 
course inside the FIWARE Cloud. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: This GE reference implementation product is only of interest to potential FIWARE instance 
providers and therefore has been used to build the basic FIWARE platform core infrastructure of the FIWARE Lab. 
If you are an application developer, you don't need to create a complete FIWARE instance locally in order 
to start building applications based on FIWARE. You may rely on instances of FIWARE GEris linked to the 
Data/Media Context Management chapter, the IoT Services Enablement chapter, the Advanced Web-based User Interface 
chapter or some GEris of the Applications/Services Ecosystem and Delivery Framework chapter (WireCloud) as well as 
the Security chapter (Access Control). Those instances are either global instances or instances you can create on 
the FIWARE Lab but can also be instance you can create by means of downloading, installing and configuring the 
corresponding software in your own premises.
